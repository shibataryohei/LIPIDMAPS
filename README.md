# LIPIDMAPS
The hierarchy table based on The LIPID MAPS® Lipid Classification System for metabolomics analysis.

## Background
The LIPID MAPS® Lipid Classification System is comprised of eight lipid categories, each with its own subclassification hierarchy. The hierarchy is provided on the [website](https://www.lipidmaps.org/data/classification/LM_classification_exp.php), but significantly inconvenient for metabolomic analysis because they are `.html` . Therefore, I generated and shared `LIPIDMAPS.csv` as the fierarchy table for the confortable anlysis.
